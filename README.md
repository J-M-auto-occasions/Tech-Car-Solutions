<p>But in real, is the concept we came up with in order to implement the new acquired knowledge in the last two weeks at Ironhack</p>

## The Project:

By learning to code in pairs, implement CRUD functionality in an app and make it look nice. 

### The guidelines:

Build a functional Express app from the ground up, in pairs. 

### Technical Requirements:

- Use Express as a foundation.
- Use Mongoose for models and database communication.
- Have at least 2 models. 
- Have validation on the models with feedback for users if their submission is invalid.
- Include sign up, log in & log out functionality with encrypted passwords (and/or social logins) and authorization (logged in users can do extra things).
- Implement all CRUD actions on models other than users. You should have the Create, Read, Update and Delete features even if they aren‚Äôt all for the same model.
- Be deployed online using Heroku so that anybody could use your app.
- Responsive design is not a requirement, but it‚Äôs nice to have.


## To run the code locally follow the next steps:

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps:</h2>
